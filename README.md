# ESP32 IoT Networking Lab

ESP32-based IoT networking experiments and smart agriculture system using Wi-Fi communication, REST APIs, and a web-based monitoring dashboard.

This repository contains a series of ESP32 experiments that demonstrate local network communication, web-based device control, sensor monitoring, and IoT automation using the Arduino framework.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore IoT networking using the ESP32 microcontroller by developing communication between embedded devices and web applications over a local network.

The project covers:

- ESP32 Wi-Fi networking
- Access Point and Station modes
- Local web server development
- HTTP communication
- REST API implementation
- Remote device control
- Sensor data monitoring
- Automated irrigation system

## Quick Start

### 1. Flash the ESP32

```bash
cd server
# Open ESP32-Server.ino in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
# Update WiFi credentials (ssid / password)
# Upload to ESP32 DevKit V1
# Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to confirm IP
```

### 2. Start the Dashboard

```bash
cd IoT-dashboard
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
# Set VITE_ESP32_API_URL to the ESP32's IP address
# Set VITE_DASHBOARD_URL to the Router's IP address:3000 for QR code generation
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` — the dashboard connects to the ESP32 and begins polling sensor data every 3 seconds.
